This is the Haskell re-implementation of the Go code presented in the talk "Go
Concurrency Patterns" by Rob Pike.

https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide

## Quickstart

Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) then

    $ stack build

You can run the examples:

    $ stack exec search10
    $ stack exec search20
    $ stack exec search21
    $ stack exec search30
